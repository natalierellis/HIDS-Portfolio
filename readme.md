## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following folders:

### 1. **Patient_Mortality_Prediction**
This folder contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict patient mortality within 180 days of their last medical exam.

#### Highlights:
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted demographic, condition, and medication features.
- **Models:** Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.
- **Evaluation:** Achieved AUC-ROC of 0.683 using Logistic Regression.

#### Key Deliverables:
- Jupyter Notebook for the pipeline
- Presentation and final report
- External dataset link (Google Drive)

### 2. **Comparative_Genomics_Pipelines**
This folder contains two bioinformatics projects that focus on analyzing clinical and genomic data to uncover biological insights.

#### Projects:
- **Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Discovery**
  - Identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients.
  - Tools: R, EnrichR
  - Key Results: Highlighted pathways related to neuronal adhesion and inflammation.

- **Bladder Cancer Immuno-Oncology Analysis**
  - Investigated immune landscape disruptions and DEGs in bladder cancer patients.
  - Tools: R, CIBERSORTx
  - Key Results: Identified disrupted pathways and immune cell profiling insights.

## Project 1: Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker Discovery  

### Objective  
Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by comparing incipient AD subjects with normal controls.  

### Tools & Skills  
- **Statistical Analysis**: DEG identification using R (T-tests).  
- **Pathway Enrichment**: Analysis with EnrichR to uncover biological pathways and molecular functions.  
- **Visualization**: Data interpretation and creation of visual outputs to summarize findings.  

### Key Results  
- Identified critical pathways for neuronal adhesion, synaptic signaling, and inflammation.  
- Highlighted genes linked to AD progression, such as **FZD8 (Wnt/β-catenin)** and **SMAD4**.  

### Takeaways  
- Developed skills in analyzing large-scale gene expression datasets.  
- Gained experience with systems biology tools for pathway analysis.  

### Project Structure  
- `input/`: Clinical and gene expression data.  
- `scripts/`: R scripts for DEG analysis and pathway enrichment.  
- `output/`: DEG results, enriched pathways, and visualizations.

## Project 2: Immuno-Oncology Applications of Genomic Data: Bladder Cancer Analysis  

### Objective  
Investigate DEGs, disrupted pathways, and immune landscape changes in bladder cancer (BC) by comparing precancerous and normal tissues.  

### Tools & Skills  
- **Statistical Analysis**: DEG identification using R (T-tests).  
- **Pathway Enrichment**: Analysis with EnrichR for biological pathways.  
- **Immune Profiling**: CIBERSORTx to analyze immune cell compositions.  
- **Visualization**: Created bar plots, stacked plots, and correlation plots in R.  

### Key Results  
- Identified key pathways, including **TLR cascade**, **MHC Class II**, and **RHO GTPase signaling**.  
- Immune cell profiling revealed a disrupted immune landscape in BC, with decreased **CD8 T cells** and increased **Tregs**.  

### Takeaways  
- Strengthened proficiency in integrating genomic and clinical data.  
- Gained experience in immune profiling and visualizing immune cell dynamics.  
- Improved understanding of cancer-specific pathways and immune responses.  

### Project Structure  
- `Step1-DEG-Pathway-Analysis/`: DEG and pathway enrichment analyses.  
  - `input/`: Clinical and gene expression data.  
  - `output/`: DEG results and enriched pathways.  
  - `scripts/`: R scripts for analyses.  
- `Step2-CIBERSORT-Analysis/`: Immune profiling and visualization.  
  - `input/`: Input files for visualization.  
  - `output/`: Immune profiling visualizations.  
  - `scripts/`: R scripts for graph generation.

## Notes  
- **Alzheimer's Project**: Fully reproducible with included input files and scripts.  
- **Bladder Cancer Project**: CIBERSORTx input files are unavailable, but all outputs and scripts for visualization are included.

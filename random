Study Summary – SweGCG 2024
Design: Nationwide, retrospective population-based cohort study
Data Source: Swedish Quality Register for Gynecologic Cancer (SQRGC)
Population: Women ≥18 years with FIGO IIIC–IV epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer treated with primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy (2008–2018)

The study found that:
	• In the total cohort (n = 1694), time to chemotherapy (TTC) after PDS did not affect 5-year relative survival.
	• In the no residual disease (R0) subgroup (n = 806), TTC >42 days was associated with:
		○ Worse 2-year relative survival (79.1%) vs. ≤28 days (91.4–91.6%).
		○ Excess mortality rate ratio (EMRR) 2.33 (p = 0.026) compared to TTC ≤21 days.
	• The effect was especially strong in stage IV R0 patients, where TTC >42 days significantly reduced 2-year survival.
	• No significant association between TTC and survival was found in patients with residual disease (R > 0).

Inclusion:
	• Women aged ≥18 years.
	• Diagnosed with FIGO stage IIIC–IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.
	• Underwent primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by platinum-based chemotherapy.
	• Histology types included: serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell.
Exclusion:
	• Received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS).
	• Had PDS without subsequent chemotherapy.
	• Received chemotherapy alone or no treatment.
	• Patients with chemotherapy start dates >90 days after surgery were excluded due to suspected registration bias.
📌 So no, patients who received neoadjuvant therapy were not included.

Time to Chemotherapy (TTC) Definition
	• TTC = Number of days between PDS and chemotherapy initiation
	• Categorized into 5 groups:
		○ ≤21 days
		○ 22–28 days
		○ 29–35 days
		○ 36–42 days
		○ 42 days
	• Reference category in regression models: TTC ≤21 days

📉 Statistical Model Used
	• Poisson regression for Excess Mortality Rate Ratios (EMRRs)
	• Relative survival (RS) computed using the Pohar-Perme estimator
	• Follow-up time: up to 5 years (with separate analyses at 2 years and 5 years)
➡️ Your adaptation: Since you're doing Cox proportional hazards regression for overall survival (OS), you'll model hazard ratios instead of EMRRs, but the covariates and handling can be similar.

Statistical Models
Step	Statistical Method	Purpose	Key Results
1	Pearson’s χ² test	To compare baseline patient characteristics across TTC groups	- Most characteristics did not differ significantly across TTC groups (age, race, ECOG, histology)- Significant differences found in:• Ascites volume (p = 0.041)• Extent of upper abdominal disease (UAD) (p = 0.002)• Grade 2–3 complications (p = 0.043)• Maintenance therapy use (p < 0.001)
2	Definition of TTC, PFS, OS	Define exposure and outcomes	- Median TTC: 19 days- Median PFS: 25.5 months- Median OS: 78.4 months- For R0 patients: PFS = 28.4 months, OS = 84.5 months
3	Univariate Cox Regression	Identify individual predictors of survival	- TTC (continuous and categorical) significantly associated with worse PFS and OS (p < 0.001)- Other significant predictors for PFS and/or OS:• ECOG performance status• ACCI• Residual disease• Extent of UAD• Histology (especially mucinous and anaplastic)• Ascites volume• Tumor grade and stage (univariate only)• Route of chemotherapy (OS only)• Maintenance therapy (PFS only)
4	Multivariate Cox Regression	Identify independent predictors of survival	✅ Significant in final multivariate model:PFS:• ECOG 3 (HR = 1.78)• Mucinous histology (HR = 2.49)• Anaplastic histology (HR = 1.41)• Extensive UAD (HR = 1.91)• Residual disease ≤5 mm (HR = 1.81), >5 mm (HR = 4.32)• TTC 22–28 days (HR = 1.65), >28 days (HR = 1.20)• Maintenance therapy (HR = 1.58)OS:• ACCI ≥4 (HR = 1.94)• ECOG 3 (HR = 1.75)• Mucinous (HR = 3.78), Anaplastic histology (HR = 2.02)• Extensive UAD (HR = 1.97)• Residual disease ≤5 mm (HR = 1.90), >5 mm (HR = 3.76)• TTC 22–28 days (HR = 1.94), ≥28 days (HR = 2.43)• Intraperitoneal chemo was protective (HR = 0.39)
5	Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves + Log-rank test	Visualize survival across TTC groups	- Significant survival differences by TTC group (p < 0.001)• For all patients: → OS dropped from 132.7 mo (7–14 days) to 48.0 mo (>28 days) → PFS dropped from 41.7 mo to 17.9 mo• For R0 subgroup: → OS: 137.3 mo to 47.8 mo → PFS: 45.6 mo to 18.7 mo• For R0 + extensive UAD: → OS: 95.3 mo to 30.6 mo → PFS: 26.3 mo to 13.8 mo
6	Linear and Cubic Regression (Continuous TTC)	Explore dose-response effect of TTC	- Both linear and cubic models were statistically significant- Showed a steep survival decline when TTC increased beyond 14 days- Cubic model captured slight non-linear acceleration in hazard with delay
7	Subgroup Analyses	Test TTC effect within R0 and high-risk groups	- Even among R0 patients, longer TTC significantly worsened survival:• OS: 137.3 mo (7–14 days) → 47.8 mo (>28 days)• PFS: 45.6 mo → 18.7 mo- In R0 + extensive UAD group, TTC still had significant impact:• OS: 95.3 mo (7–14 days) → 30.6 mo (>28 days)• PFS: 26.3 mo → 13.8 mop-values for trend significant in all subgroups

Conclusion
	• Advanced-stage EOC patients who begin chemotherapy more than 8 weeks after CRS have significantly worse overall survival.
	• For these patients, starting adjuvant chemotherapy within 6 to 8 weeks is strongly advised.
	• No significant TTC impact was found in early-stage patients.
	• Findings support early initiation of chemo post-CRS and coordination of perioperative care to minimize delays.

Additions:
	• Model TTC as a continuous variable (with splines) to capture nonlinear effects.
	• Include interaction terms (e.g., TTC × FIGO stage) to reflect stage-specific effects.
	• Consider competing risks or cause-specific Cox models if cancer-specific death data are available.
	• Add: Surgical complications, performance status (ECOG), comorbidity index (CCI), and treatment center type.
	• Capture delay reasons (clinical vs. systemic) and socioeconomic/geographic data if available.
	• Cancer-specific survival (CSS)
	• Time from diagnosis to surgery (TDS)
	• Chemotherapy completion and recurrence pattern
	• Stratify by: Histology, BRCA status, age, hospital volume, and residual disease subtype (microscopic vs. truly none).
	• Use multiple imputation for missing data.
	• Check proportional hazards assumptions.
	• Use landmark or time-varying models to account for post-op events.

📐 Statistical Techniques
	• Chi-square & Mann-Whitney U tests: Compare baseline characteristics and surgical complexity
	• Kaplan-Meier & log-rank test: Compare overall survival between standard and delayed groups
	• Cox proportional hazards model: Adjusted for all listed covariates
	• Stratified analyses: Conducted separately for patients with and without complete gross resection (CGR)
	• Sensitivity analyses:
		○ Examined survival across 2-week increments of TTC
		○ Repeated analyses using a >15-week delay threshold
🔎 Note: Although they performed stratified analyses, they did not model interactions (e.g., TTC × residual disease). A unified Cox model including interaction terms would allow formal testing of whether surgery timing effects differ by subgroup.

🧠 Key Findings
Outcome	Standard (n=2,389)	Delayed (n=2,662)	p-value
Median OS	34.3 months	33.9 months	0.13
CGR Rate	53.2%	54.5%	0.51
30-Day Readmission	4.1%	2.6%	0.003
90-Day Mortality	1.8%	3.2%	0.002
	• No significant difference in overall survival after adjustment for confounders
	• No survival difference within residual disease subgroups (CGR or residual)
	• Sensitivity analyses confirmed findings across various definitions of delay

🔬 Replication & Extension Recommendations
Methodological Enhancements
	• Model time-to-surgery as a continuous variable using restricted cubic splines
	• Add landmark or time-varying Cox models to address potential immortal time bias
	• Include progression-free survival (PFS) if available
Covariate Additions
	• Exact number of NACT cycles
	• ECOG performance status or frailty indicators
	• CA-125 response, BRCA mutation, and HRD status
	• Detailed surgical complexity score (e.g., Aletti score)
Analytical Improvements
	• Include interaction terms (e.g., TTC × residual disease, TTC × comorbidity)
	• Apply propensity score matching or inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to balance treatment groups
	• Incorporate genomic and treatment regimen data if accessible

🧾 Conclusion
In a large national cohort of over 5,000 patients, delaying interval cytoreductive surgery beyond 13 weeks after starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with worse overall survival. This suggests DICS may be safe for selected patients, especially those with comorbidities or surgical risk factors. However, prospective trials (e.g., CHRONO) are needed to determine optimal timing.

📌 Major Findings
	• Delaying chemotherapy beyond 28 days post-surgery is associated with reduced overall survival, especially in suboptimally debulked patients.
	• PFS not significantly affected by timing.
	• The timing window of 3–6 weeks post-surgery is particularly important.

🧠 Discussion Points
	• The study supports early chemotherapy, especially in patients with residual disease post-surgery.
	• Confirms prior findings that perioperative complications, performance status, and extent of surgery influence chemotherapy timing.
	• Highlights center-specific differences in outcomes and chemotherapy delays.

1. Exposure Definition
	• Time to Initiation (TI): Time (in days) between surgery and start of adjuvant chemotherapy
		○ Median TI = 32 days
		○ Patients split into early (≤32 days) vs. late (>32 days) initiation groups
2. Outcome
	• All-cause mortality (not cancer-specific)
	• Follow-up period: Up to Jan 2013
	• Survival time: From chemotherapy start to death or end of follow-up
📊 Analytic Approaches
1. Descriptive Statistics
	• Compared baseline characteristics across TI groups (≤32 vs. >32 days)
	• Variables included: age, ECOG status, FIGO stage, grade, histology, residual tumor, ascites, chemotherapy regimen
2. Kaplan–Meier Survival Curves
	• Outcome: All-cause mortality from date of chemo initiation
	• Stratified by: TI ≤ 32 days vs. TI > 32 days
	• Compared using log-rank test (p = 0.12)
	• No covariates included (unadjusted survival)
3. Cox Proportional Hazards Regression
Model Type	Exposure	Covariates Included	Result
Unadjusted	TI > 32 vs. ≤ 32 days	None	HR = 0.85 (95% CI: 0.70–1.04), p = 0.12
Adjusted	TI > 32 vs. ≤ 32 days	FIGO stage, Residual tumor	HR = 1.13 (95% CI: 0.92–1.39), p = 0.26
	• Covariates selected using 10% change-in-estimate method
	• Other variables like age, ECOG, histology, and grade were tested but not included, as they did not materially affect the HR for TI

⚠️ Why 32 Days?
	• 32 days was the observed median TI in the cohort
	• This data-driven cut-off created balanced groups for analysis
	• Although the Danish guideline recommends ≤28 days, many exceeded this, and using 32 allowed for statistical power
	• They also tested TI ≤14 days vs. >14 days (results not emphasized)

📉 Prognostic Model (Table 4)
	• Separate multivariable Cox model assessing independent predictors of mortality
	• TI was not included because it was:
		○ Not statistically significant
		○ The focus of a separate model (Table 3)
	• Chemotherapy regimen (e.g., TTC) also excluded, likely due to:
		○ Lack of prognostic power
		○ Collinearity with ECOG/age
		○ Small subgroup sizes
📦 Variables included in Table 4:
	• Age group
	• ECOG performance status
	• FIGO stage
	• Residual tumor
	• Ascites
	• Tumor grade
	• Histological subtype

🧠 Key Takeaways
	• No statistically significant association found between TI and survival
	• Strongest predictors of mortality: residual tumor and FIGO stage
	• Median 5-year survival: 42.8%
	• The study supports that earlier chemotherapy (≤32 days) may offer a modest survival benefit, but it was not statistically significant

Suggestions for Large-Scale Replication (e.g., All of Us)
1. Study Design Enhancements
	• Prospective registry linkage to improve validity
	• Include post-op performance status and reason for TI delay (hospital transfer, complications, patient preference)
2. Statistical Considerations
	• Use multiple imputation for missing values (e.g., ECOG status)
	• Consider cause-specific mortality or competing risks models
	• Apply restricted cubic splines to model TI as a continuous variable rather than binary
3. Modeling Improvements
	• Include interaction terms (e.g., between TI and residual tumor)
	• Use stratified Cox models if proportional hazards assumption fails
	• Incorporate time-varying covariates (e.g., post-op complications)
4. Covariate Expansion
	• Add comorbidity scores (e.g., Charlson index)
	• Include biomarkers (if available)
	• Capture patient-reported outcomes and surgical complications
5. High-Performance Computing
	• For scalability: Use parallelized survival modeling (e.g., lifelines, scikit-survival, pycox)
	• For reproducibility: Leverage version-controlled notebooks and DAGs (e.g., with Airflow)

	• Population: 497 women with early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (FIGO I–II)
	• Setting: GOG protocols with standardized treatment and complete surgical staging
	• Median TI (time to chemo): 23 days (IQR: 12–33)
	• Exposure (TI): Categorized for illustration into:
		○ <2 weeks
		○ 2–4 weeks
		○ >4 weeks
🔹 For regression, TI was modeled as a continuous variable

🧬 Treatment Arms
Trial	Arms
GOG 95	IV Cyclophosphamide + Cisplatin vs. IP 32P
GOG 157	Paclitaxel + Carboplatin, 3 vs. 6 cycles
Note: Chemotherapy regimens were controlled for in the multivariate model.

📊 Analytic Approaches
1. Descriptive Statistics
	• Compared patient characteristics across the three TI groups
	• Variables: age, race, stage, grade, histology, cytology, ascites, rupture, performance status, treatment regimen
2. Kaplan–Meier Curves
	• Estimated 5-year RFS and OS for each TI category
	• Log-rank test used to compare groups:
		○ RFS: p = 0.62
		○ OS: p = 0.51
3. Cox Proportional Hazards Models
	• Multivariate regression model included:
		○ TI as a continuous variable
		○ Covariates:
			§ Age
			§ Performance status (0 vs. 1–2)
			§ FIGO stage (IA/IB, IC, II)
			§ Tumor grade (1–3)
			§ Cytology (positive/negative)
			§ Treatment type (chemotherapy regimen)
	• Endpoints:
		○ RFS: from chemo start to recurrence
		○ OS: from chemo start to death
	• Software: SAS 9.1

📈 Main Results
🔹 5-Year Survival Estimates by TI Group (illustrative):
TI Group	5-Year RFS	5-Year OS
<2 weeks	72.8%	79.4%
2–4 weeks	73.9%	81.9%
>4 weeks	79.5%	82.8%
🔍 No statistically significant difference in survival across TI groups.
🔹 Cox Model Results (Adjusted Hazard Ratios):
TI Category	HR for RFS (95% CI)	p-value	HR for OS (95% CI)	p-value
2–4 weeks	0.90 (0.59–1.37)	0.62	0.87 (0.58–1.31)	0.51
>4 weeks	0.72 (0.46–1.13)	0.15	0.78 (0.51–1.19)	0.25
Global test for timing:
	• RFS: p = 0.33
	• OS: p = not significant

🧠 Key Takeaways
	• Timing of adjuvant therapy initiation was not associated with survival in early-stage ovarian cancer after adjusting for key prognostic factors.
	• Important independent predictors of survival:
		○ Age
		○ FIGO stage
		○ Tumor grade
		○ Cytology

⚖️ Strengths
	• Large dataset from prospective randomized trials
	• Uniform surgical staging and treatment protocols
	• Use of Cox models with clinically relevant covariates
⚠️ Limitations
	• Median TI was short (23 days); few patients had long delays, limiting power to detect harm from long TI
	• One regimen (IP 32P) is outdated and not used in current practice
	• Small sample size for survival differences in a generally good-prognosis population

✅ Recommended Additions for Large-Scale Study (Condensed)
1. Flexible Modeling of Time to Chemo (TI)
	• Use restricted cubic splines or generalized additive models (GAMs) to model TI as a continuous non-linear variable
	• Avoid arbitrary cutoffs (like 32 days); detect inflection points
2. Time-Dependent Covariates
	• Consider modeling TI as a time-dependent exposure if delayed chemo is related to events (e.g., post-op complications)
3. Subgroup Analyses
	• Stratify by:
		○ Histologic subtype (serous, endometrioid, clear cell)
		○ Stage (I vs. II vs. IIIA1)
		○ Residual disease status
	• Explore interaction terms between TI and these subgroups
4. Propensity Score Methods
	• Use IPTW or matching to balance confounders between early and delayed TI groups
	• Helps address treatment selection bias
5. Sensitivity Analyses
	• Vary definitions of "delay" (e.g., 28, 35, 42 days)
	• Exclude patients with early recurrence to avoid immortal time bias
6. Competing Risks Analysis
	• Use Fine & Gray models for cancer-specific mortality vs. non-cancer death
7. Missing Data Handling
	• Apply multiple imputation to avoid bias from incomplete clinical variables
8. Machine Learning Extensions (Optional)
	• Use survival forests or deep Cox models to explore non-linear, high-dimensional effects (with interpretability focus)

Study Summary:
Title: Impact of the time interval from completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to initiation of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy on survival in patients with advanced ovarian cancer
Authors: Lee YJ, Chung YS, Lee JY, et al.
Journal: Gynecologic Oncology, 2018.

Objective:
To evaluate the relationship between the time interval from completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to the initiation of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (POAC) and survival outcomes (PFS and OS) in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer.

Study Population:
	• Setting: Yonsei Cancer Hospital, South Korea
	• Time frame: 2006–2016
	• N: 194 women with FIGO stage III–IV epithelial ovarian cancer who received at least one cycle of NAC and underwent interval debulking surgery (IDS) followed by POAC

Inclusion Criteria:
	• Pathologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer
	• FIGO stage III or IV
	• Received ≥1 cycle of NAC
	• Underwent IDS and subsequent POAC at the study institution

Exclusion Criteria:
	• Still receiving POAC at time of data collection (n=9)
	• Did not undergo IDS (n=6)
	• Underwent treatment elsewhere with unavailable records (n=2)
	• Lost to follow-up (n=9)

. Descriptive Statistics
	• Used to summarize patient characteristics (e.g., age, ASA score, CA-125 levels, FIGO stage, histology, surgery type)
	• Reported as:
		○ Median (range) for continuous variables
		○ Frequency (%) for categorical variables

2. Group Comparisons
	• Patients were stratified based on the median time interval from end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to start of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy (POAC):
		○ ≤42 days (short interval)
		○ >42 days (long interval)
	• Statistical tests:
		○ Chi-square test for categorical variables
		○ Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables
→ Purpose: to check for significant differences in baseline characteristics between the two groups

3. Survival Analysis
	• Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate:
		○ Progression-Free Survival (PFS): time from diagnosis to recurrence
		○ Overall Survival (OS): time from diagnosis to death (all-cause)
	• Log-rank test used to compare survival curves between:
		○ Time interval groups (≤42 vs >42 days)
		○ Subgroups for time to surgery and time to chemo
		○ Quartiles of time interval (≤37, 38–42, 43–50, >50 days)

4. Univariate Cox Proportional Hazards Models
	• Conducted separately for PFS and OS
	• Variables tested:
		○ Age
		○ ASA score
		○ FIGO stage
		○ Histology (HGSC vs non-HGSC)
		○ Presence of residual disease
		○ Performance of radical surgery
		○ Time interval from NAC to POAC (binary: >42 vs ≤42 days)

5. Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards Models
	• Adjusted for:
		○ Age
		○ ASA score
		○ FIGO stage
		○ Histology
		○ Residual disease
		○ Radical surgery
		○ Time interval (main exposure)
	• Reported as:
		○ Hazard Ratios (HRs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs)
		○ p-values, with significance threshold: p < 0.05
	• Conducted both as:
		○ Binary analysis (≤42 vs >42 days)
		○ Quartile-based trend analysis (≤37, 38–42, 43–50, >50 days) with p for trend

6. Subgroup Analyses
	• Evaluated survival impact of:
		○ Time to surgery (NAC to IDS) using cutoff of 25 days
		○ Time from surgery to POAC using cutoff of 16 days
		○ Reasons for delay (e.g., toxicity, logistics, complications)

Main Results:
	• Median time interval (NAC to POAC): 42 days
	• Longer interval (>42 days) associated with:
		○ Worse PFS (HR 1.41; 95% CI 0.98–2.03; p=0.063, trend-level)
		○ Worse OS (HR 2.03; 95% CI 1.16–3.54; p=0.013)
	• Trend analysis across quartiles showed increased risk of recurrence and death with increasing interval:
		○ PFS: P for trend = 0.006
		○ OS: P for trend < 0.001
	• Independent predictors of worse survival:
		○ Residual disease
		○ Non-HGSC histology
		○ FIGO stage IV
		○ Time interval >42 days (for OS)

Subgroup Findings:
	• Delays >25 days to IDS associated with worse OS (p=0.026)
	• Delays >16 days from IDS to POAC not significantly associated with OS or PFS
	• Delays due to organizational shortcomings had worse outcomes than medical or patient-requested delays

Recommendations for NCDB Reproduction:
Additions Needed:
	1. Define the interval variable carefully:
		○ Use procedure and chemo start dates to replicate time from end of NAC → IDS → POAC
		○ Construct total interval and decompose into surgery and chemo initiation delays if possible
	2. Identify NAC cohorts:
		○ Use variables such as Class of Case, Sequence Number, Chemotherapy at this Facility, RX Summ--Chemo, and Systemic/Surgery Dates to determine treatment pathway
	3. Replicate key covariates:
		○ Age
		○ Histology (ICD-O-3)
		○ FIGO stage (approximate via TNM or derived stage)
		○ Residual disease: may not be directly available; consider CS Site-Specific Factors or Surgical Margins
		○ Comorbidity/functional status: use Charlson-Deyo score if ASA not available
		○ Radical surgery: infer from Site-Specific Surgery Codes
	4. Handle missing or ambiguous data:
		○ Document assumptions made in calculating timing
		○ Consider sensitivity analyses for incomplete or estimated data
	5. Potential enhancements:
		○ Use multi-level modeling to account for facility-level variability
		○ Evaluate impact of insurance, race, region (available in NCDB)
		○ Conduct instrumental variable analysis to account for potential unmeasured confounding

Timmermans et al. Gynecologic Ongology 2018 TTC PDS n1612 IDS n2485
Study Design:
	• Population-based retrospective cohort study
	• Data source: Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR), 2008–2015
	• Sample size: 4,097 patients with FIGO stage IIB–IV epithelial ovarian cancer
		○ 1,612 underwent Primary Debulking Surgery (PDS)
		○ 2,485 underwent Interval Debulking Surgery (IDS) after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NACT)
	• Included only patients with ≤1 cm residual disease and known surgery-to-chemotherapy interval

Objectives:
	1. Identify clinical and demographic predictors of prolonged time to chemotherapy (TTC)
	2. Evaluate the impact of TTC on overall survival (OS), stratified by residual disease status and treatment type

Definitions:
	• TTC: Days from surgery to start of adjuvant chemotherapy
		○ Categorized into:
			§ Early (<24 days)
			§ Intermediate (24–37 days, reference)
			§ Prolonged (>37 days)
	• Complete cytoreduction: No macroscopic residual disease
	• Optimal cytoreduction: ≤1 cm residual disease
	• Prolonged hospitalization: ≥10 days post-surgery
	• Complicated recovery: Any postoperative complication or ICU stay >1 day

Statistical Analysis Procedures:
Descriptive Statistics:
	• Categorical variables: Compared across TTC groups using Chi-square tests
	• Continuous variables: Assessed using ANOVA or Mann–Whitney U tests as appropriate
Regression Analyses:
	• Univariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of prolonged TTC (>37 days), stratified by PDS and IDS groups
		○ Covariates included: age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), FIGO stage, residual disease status, postoperative complications, hospital stay, and extent of surgery
	• Survival Analysis:
		○ Overall Survival (OS) and Progression-Free Survival (PFS) estimated using Kaplan–Meier curves
		○ Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for OS by TTC group
			§ Model I: Included only patients with no residual disease
			§ Model II: Included only patients with residual disease (≤1 cm)
			§ Covariates for Cox models included:
				□ Age
				□ FIGO stage
				□ Histologic type
				□ Tumor grade
				□ Performance status
				□ Postoperative complications
				□ Hospital stay
				□ Chemotherapy alterations (dose modifications, delays)
				□ IDS-specific models additionally adjusted for the interval between NACT and surgery
	• Statistical significance: P-value < 0.05
	• Software used: STATA/SE version 14.1 (StataCorp, Texas, USA)

Key Findings:
1. Median TTC:
	• Overall: 29 days (IQR: 24–37)
	• PDS: 31 days
	• IDS: 28 days
2. Predictors of Prolonged TTC:
	• Age ≥65, complications, hospitalization ≥10 days, and complete debulking → significantly associated with delayed TTC
	• Extensive surgery → associated with prolonged TTC in IDS group only
3. Survival Outcomes:
	• In patients with no residual disease:
		○ Prolonged TTC (>37 days) was significantly associated with worse OS:
			§ PDS: HR = 1.43 (95% CI: 1.09–1.88)
			§ IDS: HR = 1.22 (95% CI: 1.02–1.47)
	• In patients with residual disease: No significant association between TTC and OS
	• PFS: Not significantly impacted by TTC group

Conclusions:
	• Delayed initiation (>5–6 weeks) of adjuvant chemotherapy after complete cytoreduction is an independent predictor of worse OS
	• Starting chemotherapy earlier than 24 days does not provide additional survival benefit
	• Recommendation: Initiate chemotherapy within 5–6 weeks post-surgery for optimal outcomes, particularly after complete cytoreduction

ElNaggar et al. Gynecology Oncology 2018 Single Institution TTS PDS n540 IDS n91
🎯 Objective
To evaluate:
	• Compliance with the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) quality measure recommending initiation of chemotherapy within 42 days of cytoreductive surgery.
	• Whether this timing is associated with improved survival in women with epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/peritoneal cancer.

🧪 Methods
	• Dataset: 631 eligible patients from a prospectively maintained institutional ovarian cancer database (2004–2013).
	• Eligibility: Stage IA/IB grade 2–3 or stage IC and higher disease who underwent primary or interval debulking surgery and were candidates for chemotherapy.
	• Exposure: Time to chemotherapy (TTC) categorized as:
		○ Early: ≤42 days
		○ Late: >42 days
	• Statistical analyses:
		○ Cox proportional hazards models (stratified by age and stage).
		○ Adjusted for confounders: age, stage, race, insurance, surgical approach/outcome.
		○ Subgroup analyses: PDS vs IDS, residual disease vs no residual.
		○ Interaction terms tested (e.g., TTC × surgery type).
		○ Logistic regression explored predictors of delayed chemotherapy.

📊 Key Results
	• 59.1% received chemotherapy ≤42 days after surgery.
	• No significant survival benefit associated with early chemotherapy:
		○ Adjusted HR: 0.77 (95% CI: 0.59–1.01)
	• Findings persisted across:
		○ Surgery type: PDS (aHR: 0.93), IDS (aHR: 0.79)
		○ Residual disease status: No strong interaction detected (p = 0.213)
	• Factors associated with delayed chemotherapy:
		○ Presence of residual disease
		○ Higher stage
		○ Surgical approach (open vs minimally invasive — only marginal in final model)

🧠 Conclusions
	• At this NCI-designated cancer center, chemotherapy within 42 days was not associated with significantly improved overall survival.
	• The utility of the 42-day benchmark as a quality indicator is questionable.
	• Authors urge further validation of time-based quality measures before widespread implementation.

📌 Notable Strengths
	• High-quality, prospectively collected institutional dataset.
	• Rich clinical detail (e.g., residual disease, surgical approach, exact chemo dates).
	• Multiple adjusted models and stratified analyses.

⚠️ Limitations
	• Single-institution study — limited generalizability.
	• Retrospective analysis of a prospective registry.
	• No standardization of chemotherapy regimens.
	• Unmeasured confounding (e.g., postoperative recovery factors).

📄 Study Summary:
Title: Early initiation of chemotherapy following complete resection of advanced ovarian cancer associated with improved survival: NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group study
Authors: K.S. Tewari, J.J. Java, R.N. Eskander, B.J. Monk, R.A. Burger
Journal: Annals of Oncology, Volume 27, Pages 114–121, 2016
DOI: 10.1093/annonc/mdv500

🎯 Objective:
To evaluate whether time from surgery to initiation of chemotherapy (TSIC) impacts overall survival (OS) in women with advanced ovarian cancer, particularly among those with microscopic residual disease (R0) after primary debulking surgery.

👥 Study Design & Population:
	• Design: Post hoc exploratory analysis of GOG-0218, a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
	• Population: 1718 women with newly diagnosed stage III or IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma
		○ Stage IV R0 (microscopic residual) patients (n=81) were the focus for this analysis
		○ Stage III R0 patients were excluded by design

Primary Exposure
	• TSIC: Time (in days) from date of surgery to initiation of chemotherapy
		○ Treated as:
			§ A continuous variable (log-transformed)
			§ Categorical cutoffs: 25 days and 40 days
			§ Interaction term with residual disease

Primary Outcome
	• Overall Survival (OS): Time from surgery to death from any cause

Covariates
	• Age (continuous)
	• Race/ethnicity (White, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Other)
	• FIGO stage (III vs IV)
	• Tumor grade (1, 2, 3)
	• Histology (serous vs others)
	• Residual disease status (microscopic, ≤1 cm, >1 cm)
	• Performance status (0, 1, 2)
	• Presence of ascites (yes/no)
	• CA-125 (log-transformed)
	• Randomization arm (standard chemo, concurrent bevacizumab, extended bevacizumab)

Statistical Methods
1. Descriptive Analyses
	• Categorical variables: Compared using Pearson's chi-squared test
	• Continuous variables: Compared using Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney or Kruskal–Wallis test depending on number of groups
2. Survival Analyses
	• Kaplan–Meier curves: Used to visualize unadjusted OS by TSIC categories and residual disease strata
	• Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model:
		○ Included all covariates listed above
		○ TSIC modeled as:
			§ Log-transformed continuous variable
			§ Modeled nonlinearly using restricted cubic splines (RCS) to explore the shape of the association
		○ Adjusted survival curves generated using representative covariate values
3. Interaction Effects
	• Two key interactions were tested:
		○ TSIC × residual disease
		○ TSIC × race/ethnicity
	• Purpose: To determine if the effect of TSIC on OS differs by tumor burden and ethnicity
	• Interaction plots generated to illustrate hazard ratios across subgroups (see Figure 1B in paper)

Model Validation and Interpretation
	• Nonlinearity of TSIC was assessed using restricted cubic splines (validated by Molinari’s threshold selection method)
	• Statistical significance set at p < 0.05, two-tailed
	• Adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals reported
	• Software used: R statistical computing environment

🧠 Major Findings:
	• TSIC >25 days was associated with worse OS, especially in stage IV patients with microscopic residual disease
	• For this group, each 10% increase in TSIC after 25 days led to an approximate 27% increased risk of death
	• The effect of TSIC was:
		○ Strongest in patients with no gross residual disease (R0)
		○ Minimal in those with residual disease >1 cm
	• A significant TSIC × race interaction suggested Asian patients were more susceptible to delayed chemotherapy effects regardless of residual status
	• TSIC had no effect on PFS

🔍 Interpretation:
	• The findings are consistent with Gompertzian tumor kinetics and biologic models where micrometastases proliferate rapidly after surgery
	• Patients with R0 resections may benefit most from early chemotherapy initiation to suppress residual microscopic disease
	• Results emphasize the importance of avoiding delays post-surgery, especially in stage IV completely resected patients

⚠️ Limitations:
	• Retrospective, exploratory post-trial analysis (not pre-specified)
	• Reasons for delayed chemotherapy (>25 days) not collected
	• Only stage IV R0 patients included; not generalizable to all early-stage or incompletely resected patients

🛠️ Implications for Future Research / NCDB Reproduction:
If replicating in the NCDB:
	• Define TSIC precisely using surgery and chemotherapy start dates
	• Focus on stage IV patients with R0 resections if possible
	• Stratify by residual disease (may need proxy indicators)
	• Consider modeling nonlinear effects of TSIC and interactions with race/ethnicity
	• Track clinical/systemic causes of delays (if available)

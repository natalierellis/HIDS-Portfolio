1. üìÅ Handling Double IDs
If a patient has multiple TDAN surgeries and was mistakenly assigned multiple REDCap IDs:

Retain the earliest REDCap ID as the consolidated record.

Merge information from both IDs into the first ID.

Update all associated CRFs under the retained ID, ensuring no loss of data.

2. üß™ Pathology Reports and Timing
Path Report 1 must correspond with the date of TDAN Surgery 1.

Path Report 2 must correspond with the date of TDAN Surgery 2 (if applicable).

Pathology reports prior to TDAN Surgery 1:

These reports should be documented under Pre-Operative Disease.

Especially relevant in Prior Gyn Cancer cases where the tumor was removed via biopsy before surgery.

3. üß¨ Prior Gynecologic Cancer Cases
If the patient had a diagnosis of gynecologic cancer prior to TDAN surgery, and:

The TDAN surgery revealed no residual malignancy (e.g., benign tissue or normal findings):

All prior cancer information belongs in Pre-Op Disease.

Path 1:

Tumor Grade = GX or Not Applicable

Cell Type = "Other benign conditions" or "Normal tissue" depending on path report content

Site of Disease Diagnosis = original cancer site

Update the Stage and Current Distant Metastasis fields accordingly.

If stage is changed, update Current FIGO Stage.

4. üßæ Required Actions When Any Data Is Changed
Recalculate Offset Calculations.

Update the CRT Tracker (Case Review Tracker).

Set the lowest form status for the entire case (e.g., Incomplete, Unverified).

Make changes in source documentation, not just derived reports (i.e., update in REDCap and underlying documents).

Remove commas and parentheses from any updated text fields to prevent system processing issues.

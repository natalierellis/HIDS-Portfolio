Last week, we discussed examining the Summary TDAN Histology Group in the Final Diagnosis CRF. As a first step, we generated a report called PreopDzPathandFinalDx, which was filtered to include only valid DUKE cases from 2012 to the present.

Our goal was to evaluate whether the TDAN summary diagnosis group aligned with site, histology, and grade across the Preoperative Diagnosis, Pathology, and Final Diagnosis CRFs.

Taylor and I began developing a series of data quality flags focused on the tdan_dx_grp variable. These flags were designed to compare TDAN group assignments to primary site and cell type information across the different pathology forms.

Before implementing the flags, I took a step back to map out the logic for each rule. After understanding the inclusion logic for each TDAN group, I translated that logic into Python code.

I'll walk through a few examples of those flags shortly. Then, I ran the entire set of flags on our filtered dataset of valid DUKE cases since 2012, and these are the cases that were flagged based on the logic that Taylor and I defined.

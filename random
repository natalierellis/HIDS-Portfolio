Good afternoon Ch,

Thank you for your feedback — I truly appreciate it.

I wanted to clarify my earlier note about the 46 cases where the date of last contact appeared to coincide with chemotherapy initiation. Initially, I flagged these based on DX_LASTCONTACT_DEATH_MONTHS, which I converted to days by multiplying by 30. However, I now realize that using 30.417 as the conversion factor may provide a more accurate estimate, since calendar months vary in length.

Upon reviewing these cases more closely, I found that not all of the patients died; some were lost to follow-up shortly after chemotherapy began, while others may have died around the same time.

Would you recommend excluding patients whose DX_LASTCONTACT_DEATH_DAYS falls within a certain interval of DX_CHEMO_STARTED_DAYS? For example, should we exclude patients if this interval is ≤30 days, due to limited follow-up?

Looking forward to your guidance.

Best regards,
Natalie

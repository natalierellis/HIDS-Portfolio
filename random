Thank you for this. From my understanding the NCDB does not directly capture the full duration of chemotherapy treatment. As you mentioned, it includes a start date; however, the NCDB lacks variables that correspond to end dates or number of cycles, so duration cannot be calculated precisely. 

I did look into other studies, such as the one by Nasioudis et al., which also use NCDB. They mention that there is no data on the composition of the chemotherapy regimen administered or the exact number of chemotherapy cycles administered. Another study that used NCDB for studying non-small cell lung cancer indicates that NCDB does not record completion of chemotherapy date. 

Regards,

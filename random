ðŸŸ© 1. Ovarian CA Flag:
"If site_p = Mullerian, then nothing should be in site_p2."

Interpretation:
If the primary site is already designated as MÃ¼llerian (code 10), that should represent a final determination. Having values in site_p2 (suggesting another possible site) would be inconsistent.

Action:
Add a flag to identify records where site_p == 10 and site_p2 is not null â€” i.e., a conflict in site designation.

ðŸŸ© 2. Concurrent Flag:
"We should be looking for 1 surgery, 2 path reports?"

Interpretation:
For cases flagged as concurrent cancers, she may expect to see:

One surgical procedure.

Two distinct pathology confirmations (possibly suggesting 2 primaries).

Action:
Consider comparing data from the surgery form and pathology forms. This may not be codified yet, so keep it in mind for future QC logic or documentation tracking.

ðŸŸ© 3. Primary Peritoneal Clues:
"Encounter note for follow-up primary peritoneal..."
"Not radiation upfront is a sign of PP; if radiation upfront, other disease?"

Interpretation:

Primary Peritoneal Cancer (PPC) often doesnâ€™t get radiation upfront, so if a patient had radiation early, maybe it's not PPC.

She might be thinking that absence of early radiation aligns with PPC diagnosis.

Action:
This seems clinical rather than something you can flag easily yet â€” unless you have a variable for radiation timing or intent.

ðŸŸ© 4. Molecular Evidence, Surgery, and Prior Disease:
"Prior note says cancer, but surgery says no cancer â€” supposed to be following up for molecular evidence of disease."

Interpretation:
This is about discordance between:

a prior diagnosis or suspicion of cancer, and

a negative surgical finding.

She may be saying: if the surgery form says no cancer was found, but prior documentation (like clinical notes or molecular test results) suggests cancer, we should track these cases.

Action:
These might become exception cases â€” not necessarily flaggable now but could be documented manually as QC exceptions.

ðŸŸ© 5. Benign Conditions:
"Something about other benign conditions..."

Interpretation:
She might be referring to benign pathologies being misclassified or requiring exclusion from analyses.

Action:
May require checking histology codes against a list of benign vs. malignant conditions. You can ask her for clarification or refer to SEER code groupings.

ðŸŸ© 6. Staging & Site-Histology Concordance:
"We'll need to check staging..."
"...something about site and histology..."

Interpretation:

Ensure stage aligns with disease type (e.g., PPC often has advanced stage).

Make sure histology matches site (e.g., a uterine histology shouldnâ€™t be paired with an ovarian site).

Action:
These are QC checks â€” some are already part of what you're building. You might need to crosswalk histology-site rules based on SEER/NCDB definitions.

ðŸŸ© 7. QC Tracker & Exceptions:
"Maybe we'll have a QC check CRF and track exceptions so we don't waste time checking the same cases over and over again."

Interpretation:

She wants a log or tracker for cases already reviewed, or known exceptions to QC rules.

Prevent re-checking cases where a known clinical nuance overrides the flag.

Action:
Create an exceptions list (e.g., Excel sheet or tab in your QC output) where reviewed and cleared cases are stored with a note.

ðŸŸ© 8. Completed Status:
"Something about completed study status and completed and dead."

Interpretation:
She may want to differentiate between:

Completed study participation vs.

Patients who are deceased.

Action:
Check if there's a study status variable and an overall vital status variable â€” and be mindful that these can be different endpoints in your data.

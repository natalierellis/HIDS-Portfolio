	1. FINAL TDAN DIAGNOSIS
		a. Double ID: More than one TDAN Surgery, put into more than one ID -> so they reconsolidated double ID cases into one ID case (first one)
			i. Use first ID in REDCap
		b. Check CRFs that are used in this report:
			i. You will probably just need to change flag
			ii. So tdan surgery 1 -> first id -> path report 1 (Path1)
			iii. Tdan surgery 2 -> second id -> path report 2 (Path2)
			iv. BUT any path report before surg1 date goes into preop disease (Path0) and same for surgeries 
			v. Look at date of histologically confirm dx = date of surgery for CRFs
			vi. Look at tumor location on Path CRF
			vii. Prior Gyn CA had a dx before TDAN surgery and then at TDAN Sx had nothing, all in Pre Op Dx, so then in Path1, Benign 
			viii. Offset calculations:
				1) Lowest form status of the whole case, like incomplete or unverified
			ix. Site of disease -> linked to cell type -> whatever it says on path report for this site
			x. Tumor grade -> not applicable
			xi. Staging from pathology report needs to be changed
			xii. No commas or parantheses 
			xiii. Even if biopsy, if its diagnosed, it is a prior dx 
			xiv. Current distant metastasis
			xv. If changed stage -> current FIGO stage
		c. Need to go into docs 
		d. Anything that changes, go to offset calculations

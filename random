Good afternoon Ch,

Thank you for this feedback. I very much appreciate it.

I wanted to clarify the finding I had made about 46 cases dying the same day of chemotherapy initiation. I had flagged these 46 cases because DX_LASTCONTACT_DEATH_MONTHS, which I converted to DX_LASTCONTACT_DEATH_DAYS, was almost the same as DX_CHEMO_STARTED_DAYS. I had multiplied DX_LASTCONTACT_DEATH_MONTHS by 30 but I am realizing now that 30.417 might be the better number to use for this conversion given that months usually alternate between 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. 

In addition, these 46 cases did not all die - they either were lost to follow up or died around the same time chemotherapy initiated. 

After multiplying DX_LASTCONTACT_DEATH_MONTHS by 30.417 to receive DX_LASTCONTACT_DEATH_DAYS, what should be the exclusion interval when comparing DX_LASTCONTACT_DEATH_DAYS to DX_CHEMO_STARTED_DAYS? For example, if DX_LASTCONTACT_DEATH_DAYS is within 30 days of DX_CHEMO_STARTED_DAYS, should these patients be excluded? 

Regards,

Natalie

### Key Insights:
- **Patient Demographics of Intervention Cohort**:
  - Our cohort represents a diverse patient population with race categories equally represented, ensuring broad applicability of our intervention's success.
  - Approximately 75% of patients are male, helping us understand the demographics where the intervention had the most impact.
  - Most patients are in the 30-50 and 50+ age groups, aligning with hypertension risk factors.

- **Baseline Metrics**:
  - At baseline, 93.2% of referrals were inappropriate, indicating the need for stricter referral criteria.
  - Our refined referral criteria reduced inappropriate referrals from **93.2% at baseline** to **30% during the intervention period**.

- **Goal Achievement**:
  - Our target was to achieve **≤60% inappropriate referrals**. Achieving 30% surpasses this goal, demonstrating the intervention's effectiveness.

## GIF 2: Provider Adherence and Challenges

### Key Insights:
1. **Provider Adherence**:
   - Adherence measures how well providers followed management steps (e.g., Hypertension Management Forms, medication prescriptions) before referral.
   - Target adherence was **≥70%**, and most providers met or exceeded this threshold. 

2. **Analyzing Provider Performance**:
   - Dr. Aey did not meet the adherence goal, highlighted in orange for attention.
   - Using additional visualizations, we explored the correlation between patient volume and provider adherence.

3. **Challenges and Observations**:
   - Higher patient loads, such as Dr. Aey's, may impact adherence rates.
   - A scatterplot indicates a potential negative relationship between patient volume and adherence, although not statistically significant due to the small sample size.

4. **Funnel Chart**:
   - Highlights key management steps completed before referral:
     - **Hypertension Management Forms**: 80% completion.
     - **Antihypertensive Medications**: 80% completion.
     - **Lifestyle Modifications Care Plans**: 50% completion (significant gap).
   - Improving Lifestyle Modifications Care Plan completion is crucial for appropriate patient management.

## Next Steps
- **Resource Allocation**: Provide additional resources or workflow adjustments for providers managing higher patient volumes.
- **Training Initiatives**: Focus on improving Lifestyle Modifications Care Plan adherence through training and support.
- **Data Monitoring**: Continue gathering data to monitor trends and validate findings with a larger sample size.
